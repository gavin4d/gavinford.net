    <h2>
      That much force!
    </h2>
    <p>
      The force a object feels as it spins around is given by the following formula:
      \[F=\frac{m \times v^2}{r}\]
      For a 3lb robot, this tends to mean that your wheels are experiencing accelerations on the order of 10,000
      \(\frac{m}{s^2}\). That’s a lot of force.

      It is challenging to create a robot that not only can survive the constant centripetal acceleration but also the
      impact forces of hitting an opponent.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Make the Robot Survive Itself
    </h2>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The force felt by both robots in an impact will be
      equal, so for a meltybrain to be able to hit an opponent and survive, all of its internal components must be
      capable of surviving very high accelerations. In the following sections I will go over some of the best practices
      to keep all of the meltybrain’s internals working after impacts.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Drivetrain robustness
    </h2>
    <p>
      The meltybain’s drivetrain is the most critical component and often the only moving mechanism on a meltybrain.
      Therefore, it is critical to make it robust.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Wheels
    </h3>
    <p>
      The wheels will experience very high centrifugal force, so they must be securely fastened so they do not fly off
      and melt into the frame. It is highly recommended to find a drive motor with good threaded mounting holes on the
      rotor can. This allows the wheels to be bolted directly to the motor and reduces the risk of it detaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wheels should be made from a strong material with a thin soft layer for traction. Remember there will be about
      a thousand times the force of gravity pulling on this. It must be strong to not bend outwards or expand radially.
      People have had success using TPU wheels in 3lb, or silicone o-rings in lighter classes. Cleats are also a good
      option if the area has wooden flooring. Regardless of the wheel type, the width of the wheel should be kept to a
      minimum. As a wide wheel spins, the inside of the wheel will travel a shorter distance compared to the outside and
      the wheel must slip, which reduces the effectiveness of the robot.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Motor
    </h3>
    <p>
      The drive motors can be mounted facing inwards or outwards. There are benefits and drawbacks to both ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the motors facing inwards makes the centrifugal force push the motor can onto the motor, which does not
      require external bearings. However, because the wheels are closer to the center, it requires the motor to apply
      higher torque, which most motors are already lacking. This will increase spin up time.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an outwards facing motor, the wheel must be supported with a bearing on the outside. This external bearing
      can be larger than the motor’s internal bearing, which increases the strength of the system. This bearing must
      withstand large axial loads so a thrust or tapered bearing is recommended. A combination of thrust bearing for
      axial loads and ball bearing radial loads can be successful when tapered bearings are impractical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the drive motors are not coming to an immediate stop as they would in a hub motor weapon design, battle
      hardening the motors by adding epoxy between the rotor magnets will help strengthen the drivetrain. There are many
      guides available on the internet about battle hardening motors, so I will not cover it here.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Wiring robustness
    </h2>
    <p>
      In many combat robots the wiring is often left as an afterthought to be shoved into the robot a few minutes before
      the match. In a meltybrain, this will not be sufficient. Loose wiring will quickly degrade in the high forces of a
      meltybrain. It is highly recommended to mount all of the electronics boards securely to the frame. This will keep
      everything in place and is required for accelerometers which are commonly used in meltybrains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most wiring failures occur on a solder joint between a printed circuit board (PCB) and a wire. When a wire is
      soldered to a PCB, it wicks some solder into the strands of the wire and creates a brittle section of the wire. If
      this section is repeatedly bent or stressed, it can break. When wiring a meltybrain, it is recommended to keep all
      the wires supported, but it is highly important to add support to wires near a solder joint.
