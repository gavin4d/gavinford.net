    <h2>
      Weight Stackup
    </h2>
    <p>
      The main benefit of a meltybrain in combat robotics is that it can use the entire weight limit as the rotational
      mass, so the weight of the components do not need to be as light as a traditional robot. However, the location of
      the weight can increase the amount of energy that the robot can store. The amount of energy that a spinning mass
      can hold at a given rotational velocity is the moment of inertia:
      \[I = m r^2\]
      Where, I is the moment of inertia, m is the mass, and r is the radius. This means that the farther out the weight
      is, the more energy it will be able to hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following are some estimated weights of the different parts in a meltybrain. These weights are compiled from
      several different successful meltybrains and are a good recommendation for component weights.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>10-15% Motors</li>
      <li>10% Battery</li>
      <li>60% Frame + Weapon</li>
      <li>15% Misc.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>
      Motors
    </h2>
    <p>
      Because of the speed at which meltybrains spin, they are able to direct drive on a brushless motor. The Kv should
      be on the lower end of what is available. The lower the Kv the faster spin up will but it will have a lower max
      speed. The weight of the motor should be about 10-15% of the total weight of the robot.
    </p>
    <h2>
      ESCs
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ESC will depend on the power of the motor. It should be a bit larger than the maximum current value of the
      brushless motor.

      One consideration that must be made when deciding an ESC is if it can send the wheel speed back to the
      microprocessor. The most common firmware for an 8bit ESC is BLHeli_s, which does not have bidirectional DShot. It
      is possible to reflash most 8bit ESCs to BlueJay which can send back wheel speed. Most 32bit ESCs will be able to
      run bidirectional DShot out-of-the-box.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Frame
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two common designs for meltybrains; either everything is mounted to a large metal ring, or there is a
      central frame which everything including the weapon is mounted to. Both methods have been used to create
      competitive robots. An external frame can provide good protection on the side but leaves the internals more
      exposed to undercutters. The large metal ring can also pose a challenge to manufacture.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Weapon
    </h2>
    <p>
      In combat robotics there is a principle of bite. This is the maximum depth that a robot can hit into the opponent.
      Bite is a function of the robot’s speed “v” and the weapon’s rotational frequency “f”:
      \[bite = \frac{v}{f}\]
      This means that to increase bite you can either increase the speed a robot moves or reduce the speed of the
      weapon. The operating principle of a meltybrain is that it can operate at a low rotational velocity while still
      storing high amounts of energy.
      To maximize the energy that the robot can store, the weapons should follow the same principle for the rest of the
      components, the weapon’s mass should be concentrated on the outer perimeter of the meltybrain.
