      Processors
    </h1>
    <p>
      Meltybrains are unique in combat robotics because they are actual robots. They take sensor inputs and automate
      tasks. Due to this complexity a meltybrain requires a main processor to process sensor inputs and perform
      translational drift. The main processor must be capable of reading sensors, getting driver input, calculating
      motor powers for drifting, and controlling the motors, hundreds of times a second. For good control the processor
      should loop at around 1 kHz.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Common Processors
    </h2>
    <p>
      Although they are sometimes used, Arduinos and other 8bit processors are not recommended for meltybrains. Unless
      they are running hyper optimized code most chips will not be able to keep up with the processing requirements of a
      meltybrain. Following are some of the commonly used processors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>
          ESP32-S3
        </h3>
        <p>
          The ESP32-S3 chip is one of espressifâ€™s best chips. It has plenty of processing power and has a decent number
          of libraries. It can be purchased as a small module which can be soldered on top of a PCB, which makes it
          highly convenient. It also has a Bluetooth and WiFi antenna which can be connected to a gamepad. Using
          Bluetooth control is not recommended in weight classes above 1lb due to potential unreliability.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>
          Teensy4.1
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Teensy4.1 has a super high power chip that will be able to process anything to throw at it. It also has
          good community support. Teensy4.1 is probably the best processor you can get in a dev board.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>
          STM32 chips
        </h3>
        <p>
          The high performance line up of STM32 processors are well supported and high speed. These processors are also
          used as industry standard in many devices. They are reliable and decently well documented.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>
          RP2350
        </h3>
        <p>
          The RP2350 or RP2040 are decently powerful microcontrollers made by raspberry pi. These processors have well
          fleshed out documentation. However, the RP2350 has an error that causes it to sometimes output around 2V.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Radios
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are a few options for radios. The most common is to use an ELRS radio that communicates to the processor via
      UART. ELRS uses LoRa to transmit data so it can transmit with a slight signal. This means that even if the antenna
      gets hit it may still be able to transmit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, there is the SBUS protocol. This protocol transmits 16 servo outputs through an inverted serial
      interface. This is a simpler protocol and is commonly used by FrSky.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using a Bluetooth enabled processor, it can be possible to drive the robot with a gamepad. However,
      this is not recommended for heavier weight classes due to reliability and safety issues.
