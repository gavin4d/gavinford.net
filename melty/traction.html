      Traction Control
    </h1>
    <p>
      Although not common in most meltybrains, a traction control system can play an integral role in the
      competitiveness of a meltybrain. Using a traction control algorithm, a robot can decrease its spin up time, reduce
      wear on the wheels, and make driving easier.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Getting wheel speed
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are several methods of obtaining the speed on the wheels on a meltybrain. There are encoders of many
      varieties that will read the wheel speed with high accuracy. However, the simplest method is to ask the ESC to
      report back the speed it is driving the motor. This requires the ESC to be DShot compatible and support
      bidirectional communication. Almost all 32bit ESC will be able to do this. With a 8bit ESC it may need to be
      reflashed to run BlueJay.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Detecting slip
    </h2>
    <p>
      Using the size, position, and angular velocity of the wheels, the robot can calculate a rough angular velocity of
      the whole robot. If this reading does not match the main angular velocity reading from an accelerometer or other
      sensor, the robot is slipping. There will always be a slight discrepancy between the two readings, so a tolerance
      must be used. This tolerance will depend on accuracy of the wheel speed reading and wheel diameter, and it must be
      found experimentally for each meltybrain.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Preventing slip
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order for the wheels to maintain traction, the force applied by the motors can never exceed the static friction
      of the tire on the floor.
      With a known moment of inertia and angular acceleration, the robot can calculate the force that it is applying at
      the wheels using this formula.
    </p>
    <p>
      \[f_w = \frac{I \alpha}{r}\]
      Where \(f_w\) is the force applied by the wheel, I is the moment of inertia of the robot (found from CAD),
      \(\alpha\) is the angular acceleration of the robot, and r is the radius of the wheels on the robot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using this force and the weight of the robot, the ratio of friction force to normal force must never exceed the
      coefficient of static friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      \[\frac{f_w}{N} < \mu_s\] Where N is the magnitude of the normal force, and \(\mu_s\) is the coefficient of static
        friction. </p>
        <p>
          The coefficient of static friction limits the angular acceleration of the robot. This coefficient will depend
          on
          the robotâ€™s wheel material, the surface material, and any other dust or liquid on the tire. The best way to
          obtain
          the coefficient of static friction is to find it experimentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The robot can maintain a coefficient of friction, which can be reduced if there is a slip detected and could
          be
          increased if no slipping occurs.
